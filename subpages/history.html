            <div class="hidden-info">
                <img src="../images/Alexey.jpg" alt="Alexey Pajitnov, the creator of Tetris" class="float-left-image">

                <p>Tetris was made by Russian computer engineer Alexey Pajitnov in <strong>1984</strong>. He was working
                    at the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre in the Soviet Union. Pajitnov created the game as a fun puzzle
                    because he loved a game called pentominoes. He created the game on an Electronika 60 computer, using
                    text blocks instead of graphics. </p>
                <p>As the game became popular beyond Moscow, it reached Hungary. There, Robert Stein from Andromeda
                    Software found it and wanted to make it official. He contacted Alexey Pajitnov and tried to get a
                    license from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Though they didn’t reach a deal, his
                    efforts inspired other companies to
                    pursue agreements with Pajitnov and the Soviet government. In 1989, Nintendo won the rights to the
                    handheld and console versions of Tetris, becoming the first experience for many people worldwide.

            <h2>Cultural Influence</h2>
            <div class="hidden-info">
                <p>Tetris was also a big hit in arcades. In 1988, Atari released Tetris as an arcade game, and soon
                    after, Nintendo brought it to their home consoles. These versions helped Tetris reach even more
                    players. Around this time, many arcades were beginning to close as people chose to play games on
                    handhelds and home consoles instead. But Tetris stayed popular. Its simple but challenging gameplay
                    made it fun and addictive for people of all ages. As gaming spread to more people and places, Tetris
                    became one of the first video games to cross cultural boundaries—it was enjoyed by people around the
                    world, no matter their language or age.
                </p>

                <p>The game’s iconic falling blocks and catchy music became symbols in pop culture. The famous music of
                    Tetris, called <strong>"Korobeiniki,"</strong> comes from a Russian folk song from the 19th century.
                    Tetris influenced other puzzle games and helped shape the gaming industry. Even today, Tetris is
                    remembered as a classic, and its design inspired many other games. Tetris showed that games could be
                    simple yet endlessly replayable,and it set the standard for puzzle games that came after it.

            <div class="hidden-info">
                <p><strong>Since its 1980s debut,</strong> <em>Tetris</em> has left a lasting mark on gaming, setting a
                    standard for puzzle games and influencing game design across genres. Starting as a simple PC game,
                    it quickly became a global hit, and its reach expanded as new versions were released on virtually
                    every major platform. The 2000s saw a major change with releases like <em>Tetris DS</em>, which
                    sold millions, and the iPod version, Apple’s top download. This period proved that even a classic
                    could thrive on modern devices, appealing to a new wave of players.
                </p>
                <p>In 2008, <em>Tetris Party</em> for the Wii brought the game into living rooms with new multiplayer
                    modes that attracted both casual and competitive gamers, paving the way for other online puzzle
                    experiences. Later, <em>Tetris Ultimate</em> arrived on Steam, and <em>Tetris 99</em> on the
                    Nintendo Switch brought the battle royale concept to the franchise, capturing the attention of yet
                    another generation.
                </p>
                <p>With each new version, <em>Tetris</em> brought in fresh, creative twists and
                    kept players hooked with new features, all while staying true to its basic, familiar gameplay. These
                    updates keep it exciting and relevant, but at its core, it’s still the same classic puzzle game
                    players know and love.
                </p>
                <p><em>Tetris</em> continues to have a big impact on gaming, with its easy-to-learn and addictive design
                    inspiring many games that came after it.

                <p>The Classic Tetris World Championship (CTWC) began in 2010 in Portland, Oregon, establishing the
                    foundation
                    for organized competitive Tetris play. Jonas Neubauer dominated the early years as a seven-time
                    champion. In 2018, Joseph Saelee introduced a revolutionary "hypertapping" technique, where players
                    tap the controller
                    extremely rapidly instead of holding it down, allowing for faster piece movement and higher scores.
                </p>
                <p>Modern competitive Tetris features both high-score chasing and speedrunning as core elements, with
                    world records
                    frequently being broken by elite players pushing the game's limits. The tournament continues to be
                    exciting,
                    filled with intense gameplay and amazing skill.
