                <p>Tetris was made by Russian computer engineer Alexey Pajitnov in <strong>1984</strong>. He was working
                    at the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre in the Soviet Union. Pajitnov created the game as a fun puzzle
                    because he loved a game called pentominoes.</p>
