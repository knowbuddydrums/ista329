                    <p>In Classic Tetris multiple shapes of varying color drop from the top of the screen.
                        The player is able to rotate and horizontally move the shapes as they fall to the
                        bottom of the play area. The goal of the game is for the player to complete as many
                        lines as possible with the falling shapes before reaching the top of the play area.
                        In this game, the player advances to the next level after completing ten lines on a given
                        level. As levels increase, the speed at which the blocks fall increase making the game
                        more difficult as time progresses.

                    <p>
                        Tetris 99 mechanically plays very similar to classic tetris. The main difference is that 99 players are playing all at once. 
                        The goal objective of Tetris 99 is to be the last player standing. In this version of tetris clearing lines sends "garbage" 
                        blocks to opposing players making their play space smaller. This makes it so they reach the top of the screen faster, leading to them being 
                        eliminated from the game. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Gameplay Description:</h3>
                    <p>
                       In Tetris Effect the majority of the gameplay mechanics are the same as the original Tetris. Tetris Effect
                       is a visually more dynamic experience than the original Tetris as new animations have been created and each stage has
                       its own unique graphics. The new twist Tetris Effect introduces is the "Zone". Clearing lines increases the Zone meter 
                       which a player is able to active. When the Zone is active gravity stops and finished lines move to the bottom of the play area. 
                       The Zone state ends when time runs out or when the player reaches the top of the play area. Once the Zone is finished all finished
                       lines are cleared. The highest Zone clear is named "WTFtris", which requires the player to finish 25+ lines while in the 
                       Zone state.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sand Tetris, also known as Sandtris is a game based off the original Tetris. Sandtris introduces one new 
                        gameplay element. Falling blocks no longer stay as blocks one they have been placed. Instead, the blocks become sand.
                        To clear a line in Sandtris sand of the same color must reach from the left of the gameplay area, to the right of the 
                        gameplay area. This game requires the player to be careful when placing blocks to prevent unwanted sand colors from interfering
                        with a potential line clear. 
                    </p>
