                    <p>In Classic Tetris multiple shapes of varying color drop from the top of the screen.
                        The player is able to rotate and horizontally move the shapes as they fall to the
                        bottom of the play area. The goal of the game is for the player to complete as many
                        lines as possible with the falling shapes before reaching the top of the play area.
                        In this game, the player advances to the next level after completing ten lines on a given
                        level. As levels increase, the speed at which the blocks fall increase making the game
                        more difficult as time progresses.

                    <p>
                        Tetris 99 mechanically plays very similar to classic tetris. The main difference is that 99 players are playing all at once. 
                        The goal objective of Tetris 99 is to be the last player standing. In this version of tetris clearing lines sends "garbage" 
                        blocks to opposing players making their play space smaller. This makes it so they reach the top of the screen faster, leading to them being 
                        eliminated from the game. 
                    </p>

                        Tetris has many variations since it first came out. It started with classic 8-bit versions on old
                        consoles
                        and has evolved to include modern multiplayer versions on mobile devices. Here are some of its
                        different versions:

                        Tetris revolutionized the puzzle genre and is considered one of the greatest video games of all
                        time. Its
                        influence can be seen in modern games that incorporate block mechanics and puzzle-solving
                        challenges.
                        Tetris has sold over 100 million copies worldwide and continues to be a beloved classic.
