                You've got the <span class="highlight">Square-Block</span>! This block is the most stable and
                predictable piece.
                <br>
                Its 2x2 square shape makes it easy to place and perfect for filling square gaps.
                <br>
                The Square-Block is great for building a solid foundation and keeping your stack organized.
                <br>
                While itâ€™s less flexible than other blocks, its simplicity can be a big advantage in tough spots.
